# Recursion

Recursion is useful when a problem needs to be broken down into smaller versions of the same problem

Recursion is achieved when a function calls itself.

A recursive function must have a base case that terminates the recursion.

Recursion may simplify solving a problem, but is not always necessarily the faster solution.
