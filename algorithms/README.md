## Algorithm Design Techniques

Below is an overview of some common algorithm design techniques. I will further explore these topics with additional resources.

Brute Force: Simple and exhaustive technique that evaluates every possible outcome to find the best solution (ex. linear search)

Greedy: Choose the best option at the current time, without any consideration for the future (ex. Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm)

Divide and Conquer: Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then solved and the partial solutions are recombined to determine the overall solution (ex. binary search, quick sort, merge sort, tower of hanoi)

Dynamic Programming: Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. Break it down into smaller but overlapping sub-problems. Store the result and use it for the same sub-problems. This is called memoization and is an optimization technique that improves the time complexity of your algorithm (ex. fibonacci and climbing staircase)

Backtracking: Generate all possible solutions. Check if the solution satisfies all of the given constraints and only then you proceed with generating subsequent solutions. If the constraints are not satisfied, backtrack and go on a different path to find the solution (ex. N-Queens problem)

## Additional Problems

To be implemented soon:

- Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) using Euclidian algorithm
- Finding permutations and combinations of a list of numbers
- Finding the longest common substring in a given string
- Knapsack problem
