# Algorithm Analysis

## Time Complexity

Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

## Space Complexity

Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

## Representing Time and Space Complexity

1: Big-O Notation = worst case complexity (we are primarily concerned with this)
2: Omega Notation - best case complexity
3: Theta Notation - average case complexity
