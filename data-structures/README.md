# Data Structures

Whereas algorithms are not language-specific, different languages have different data structures. I will be implementing data structures in JavaScript.

It is possible to implement a data structure in several different ways.

## What is a Data Stucture?

A data is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently. It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data. 

Almost every web application involves data that is modelled a certain way. To efficiently manage that data, you need data structures.

Selecting the right data structure can save time and memory in your application.

More familiar to web developers may be the document object model (DOM), which is a tree data structure.

## Built-In Data Structures in JavaScript

- Arrays
- Objects
- Sets
- Maps

## Custom Data Structures

- Stacks
- Queues
- Circular Queues
- Linked Lists
- Hash Tables
- Trees
- Graphs
