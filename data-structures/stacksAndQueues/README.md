# Stacks

A stack is a sequential collection of elements that follows the last in first out (LIFO) principle.

The last element to be inserted into the stack is the first element to be removed.

A stack is an abstract data type and is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model. In other words, it is a list, but what makes it a stack is how it behaves.

Supports two main operations:
- Push (adds an element to the collection)
- Pop (removes the most recently added element from the collection)

## When a Stack is Used

- Browser history tracking (back and forward buttons)
- Undo operation when typing
- Expression conversions
- Call stack in JavaScript runtime

See stack.js in this folder for a simple implementation of a stack.
