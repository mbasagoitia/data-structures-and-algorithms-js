// Identify the pivot element in the array (can be first, last, median, random element)
// We will use the last element as the pivot in this solution

// Traverse the entire array and put everything that is smaller than the pivot
// into a "left" array and everything greater than the pivot into a "right" array

// Repeat the process for the individual left and right arrays until you have an array of length 1
// which is sorted by definition

// Repeatedly concatenate the left array, pivot, and right array until you have one sorted array
