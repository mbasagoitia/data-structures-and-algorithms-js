# Arrays

## Features and Functionality
Arrays are data structures that store elements in a particular memory location or index.

Can be declared with the Array constructor:
const array = new Array()

or using array literal notation:
const array = [];

Have a variety of array methods available used for modifying and looping through the array
for... of loop

## Array Operations
In these exercises, I am implementing common array operations to solve problems without using built-in array methods.

Using loops, conditionals, and variables to perform the operation.
