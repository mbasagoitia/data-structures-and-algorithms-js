# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository documents my learning of data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. Coming from a web development background, I am less familiar with data structures and algorithms and am deepening my understanding of the language and of programming in general. Each day, I will complete questions on a specific topic and include my explanation of logic. I will also include more efficient solutions that I find online and work through them to better understand different approaches.

## Additional Resources

Other than the list of topics provided, I will explore resources on Big O Notation to learn about time and space complexity. Additional practice questions and topics will come from Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into folders, each focusing on a specific topic related to data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

Arrays: Solutions and explanations for array-related problems.
Dynamic Programming: Dynamic programming solutions and explanations.
Hash Tables: Implementations and challenges related to hash tables.
Linked Lists: Implementation and exploration of singly and doubly linked lists.
Recursion: Examples and practice problems involving recursion.
Searching Algorithms: Implementations of searching algorithms, such as linear and binary search.
Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, and more.
Stacks and Queues: Implementation and applications of stacks and queues.
Trees: Binary tree and binary search tree implementations, along with traversal algorithms.

Each folder contains JavaScript files with solutions and explanations. The goal is to progressively cover a wide range of data structures and algorithms.

## Installation and Usage

To explore the content in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/mbasagoitia/data-structures-and-algorithms-js.git

Navigate to the Project Folder:

cd data-structures-and-algorithms-js

Explore Topics:

Each folder corresponds to a specific topic. Navigate to the desired folder to access the JavaScript files with solutions and explanations.

Run JavaScript Files (Optional):

If you want to run the JavaScript files, make sure you have Node.js installed. You can then execute the files using the following command:

node folderName/fileName.js

Replace folderName and fileName with the appropriate folder and file names.
